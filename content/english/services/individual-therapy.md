    - title: "CBT - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"
      short_name: "CBT"
      description: "The most effective approach for anxiety and depression. I teach you to identify and modify automatic negative thoughts that affect your emotions and behaviors."
      how_it_works: "We understand the connection thoughts → emotions → behaviors. Identify cognitive distortions (catastrophizing, all-or-nothing thinking). Challenge and replace negative thoughts with more realistic ones. Practice new behaviors to reinforce change."

# FAQ Mini
faq_mini_title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Individual Therapy"
faq_mini_subtitle: "Everything you need to know"

faq_items:
    - question: "How long does individual therapy last?"
      answer: "It depends on problem complexity. For mild-moderate anxiety or depression, 12-20 sessions (3-5 months) are usually sufficient. For complex trauma or personality disorders, it may last 6-24 months. In the first session, we establish a realistic estimate based on your situation."

    - question: "How often do I need to come to therapy?"
      answer: "Initially, we recommend weekly sessions to build momentum and see rapid results. As you progress, we space out sessions (biweekly, monthly). Frequency adapts to your needs and availability."

    - question: "What if I don't connect with the therapist?"
      answer: "The therapeutic relationship is essential for success. If after 2-3 sessions you feel it's not a good fit (different style, lack of connection), we discuss openly. If necessary, I can refer you to a more suitable colleague. Don't take it personally - each therapist has a different style, and it's important to find the right match."

    - question: "Can I do therapy online or only in-person?"
      answer: "**Both!** Online therapy (Zoom, Google Meet, Skype) is as effective as in-person, according to recent studies. Many clients prefer online for flexibility (no transportation time, can do therapy from any location). You choose what suits you better."

    - question: "How do I know if therapy is working?"
      answer: "We use scientifically validated questionnaires (GAD-7 for anxiety, PHQ-9 for depression, PCL-5 for trauma) that you complete every 4-6 sessions. We compare scores to see objective progress. Plus, you'll feel the difference in daily life: sleep better, feel calmer, function better at work/relationships."

    - question: "Is it safe to share very personal information?"
      answer: "**Absolutely.** Confidentiality is sacred in psychotherapy and protected by law. Everything we discuss remains between us, according to the psychologists' code of ethics and GDPR. The only legal exceptions (extremely rare): imminent risk of suicide/homicide or child abuse. Otherwise, NOTHING we discuss leaves the office."

    - question: "How does therapy differ from talking to a friend?"
      answer: "Friends offer support but don't have professional training to identify deep patterns, offer validated techniques, measure objective progress. Therapy is structured, evidence-based, confidential, and focused on real change. Plus, the therapist isn't emotionally involved in your life, so can offer objective perspectives."

## Why Choose Individual Therapy With Me?

### Vast Experience in Complex Issues
15+ years working with anxiety (generalized, panic, social phobia), depression (mild, moderate, severe), trauma (abuse, loss, PTSD), personal development, and personality disorders. I've seen and resolved hundreds of complex situations.

### Evidence-Based Approach, Not Improvisation
I only use methods supported by rigorous scientific research:
- **CBT**: 70-80% improvement in anxiety/depression (meta-analyses)
- **EMDR**: Recommended by WHO for PTSD
- **Mindfulness**: 30-40% symptom reduction (RCT)

I don't improvise - I follow internationally validated protocols.

### Real Personalization, Not "Cookie-Cutter"
There's no one-size-fits-all approach. Each therapeutic plan is built for you, based on:
- Your specific needs (anxiety? depression? trauma?)
- Your resources (what has helped you so far?)
- Your learning style (practical? reflective?)
- Your unique goals (what do you want to achieve?)

### Objectively Measured Progress, Not Guessing
We don't work endlessly without knowing if it's working. We use:
- **Validated questionnaires**: GAD-7, PHQ-9, PCL-5 (completed every 4-6 sessions)
- **SMART objectives**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable
- **Self-monitoring**: Thought journals, mood trackers

You know exactly where you are and how much you've progressed.

### Completely Safe and Non-Judgmental Space
Private physical office (Bucharest, Unirii area) or secured online (Zoom with end-to-end encryption). You can be vulnerable without fear. You won't be judged, criticized, or forced to do anything you're not comfortable with.
