# FAQ Mini
faq_mini_title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Couples Therapy"
faq_mini_subtitle: "Everything you need to know"

faq_items:
    - question: "How long does couples therapy take?"
      answer: "It depends on problem severity. For moderate conflicts and communication improvement, 12-20 sessions (3-5 months) are usually sufficient. For infidelity or deeper problems, it may take 6-12 months (20-30 sessions). In the first session we establish a realistic estimate."

    - question: "What if only one of us wants therapy?"
      answer: "It's ideal for both to come, but we understand sometimes one partner is reluctant. You can start alone with individual therapy focused on the relationship, or come to a first session alone and see how we can attract your partner. Many couples start this way and the reluctant partner joins after seeing the benefits."

    - question: "Will therapy save our relationship or help us separate?"
      answer: "The goal of couples therapy is not necessarily to keep you together, but to help you make the best decision for both. Some couples save their relationship, others realize divorce is healthier. Both outcomes are valid if they're conscious and mature, not from anger or fear."

    - question: "What if the therapist takes one partner's side?"
      answer: "A good couples therapist is NEUTRAL and doesn't take sides. My role is to understand each perspective, validate both sides and help you find solutions together. If you ever feel I'm taking someone's side, please speak up - it's important to discuss."

    - question: "Can we do couples therapy online?"
      answer: "**Yes!** Online couples therapy (Zoom) is as effective as face-to-face, according to studies. Many prefer online for comfort (do therapy from home, no transport stress). Important: both should be in the same room, not each in a different place."

    - question: "What if one of us is still having an affair?"
      answer: "For infidelity therapy to work, the affair MUST stop completely. If the unfaithful partner is not ready to end the affair, we cannot work on rebuilding trust. Total transparency is essential."

    - question: "How often should we come?"
      answer: "Initially we recommend weekly sessions for momentum. As you progress, we space to biweekly, then monthly. For acute crises (recently discovered infidelity), sometimes we recommend 2 sessions/week the first 2-3 weeks."

## Why Choose Couples Therapy With Me?

### Extensive Experience in Couples Therapy
15+ years working with couples at all stages: newly formed wanting to prevent problems, couples in acute crisis, couples considering divorce, couples rebuilding after infidelity. I've seen and helped hundreds of couples.

### Scientifically Validated Methods
I only use methods with proven success rates:
- **Gottman Method**: 70%+ improvement (Gottman Institute research)
- **CBT for Couples**: 60-70% improvement in relationship satisfaction
- **EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy)**: 70-75% improvement

I don't improvise - I follow internationally validated protocols.

### Absolute Neutrality
I don't take either partner's side. My role is to understand both perspectives, validate both emotions and help you find solutions together. Every voice counts equally.

### Personalized Approach
Every couple is unique. What works for one couple may not work for another. I adapt methods to your communication style, your values, your specific problems.

### Safe Space For Both
Private office (Bucharest, Unirii area) or secure online (Zoom). Both partners must feel safe to be vulnerable. We create clear rules of mutual respect from the first session.
