# Methods Used
methods_used:
  enable: true
  title: "Family Therapy Methods I Use"
  subtitle: "Validated systemic approaches"
  description: "Family therapy is different from individual therapy. The focus is on relationships and systems, not isolated individuals."

  methods:
    - title: "Structural Family Therapy"
      short_name: "Structural"
      description: "Developed by Salvador Minuchin. Focused on restructuring boundaries, hierarchies and alliances in the family to create a healthier structure."
      how_it_works: "We identify current structure: who is allied with whom, where are boundaries (too diffuse or too rigid), who has power. We restructure through active techniques: strengthening parental subsystem, clarifying boundaries, redistributing power. Practically, we change the family's 'architecture'."
      best_for:
        - "Families with unclear boundaries (parentification, intrusion)"
        - "Children/adolescents' behavioral problems"
        - "Chaotic or too rigid families"
        - "Conflicts between subsystems (parents vs. grandparents)"
      success_rate: "70%+ improvement in children's behavioral problems (clinical studies)"
      duration: "12-20 sessions"

    - title: "Strategic Family Therapy"
      short_name: "Strategic"
      description: "Developed by Jay Haley. Focused on solving specific problems through direct strategic interventions and changing repetitive patterns."
      how_it_works: "We identify problematic cycles (what triggers conflict, how it escalates, how it ends). We intervene strategically to interrupt the cycle. Sometimes we use 'therapeutic paradoxes' (prescribing the symptom). Focus is on changing behavior, not necessarily understanding."
      best_for:
        - "Specific concrete problems (provocative behavior)"
        - "Repetitive conflict cycles"
        - "Families resistant to introspection"
        - "Crisis situations requiring rapid change"
      success_rate: "65-70% improvement for behavioral problems"
      duration: "10-16 sessions"

    - title: "Multigenerational Family Therapy (Bowen)"
      short_name: "Bowen"
      description: "Developed by Murray Bowen. Focused on understanding transgenerational patterns, self-differentiation and reducing emotional anxiety in the system."
      how_it_works: "We explore family genogram (3-4 generations) to identify repetitive patterns (divorces, addictions, mental illness, conflicts). We understand 'emotional cutoff' and triangulation. We work on differentiation (being yourself without being controlled by family of origin). We reduce emotional fusion and reactivity."
      best_for:
        - "Repetitive transgenerational patterns"
        - "Emotional cutoff (members who no longer speak)"
        - "Chronic anxiety in family"
        - "Adults wanting to understand impact of family of origin"
      duration: "20-30 sessions (longer process)"

    - title: "Narrative Therapy for Families"
      short_name: "Narrative"
      description: "Developed by Michael White and David Epston. Helps families re-write 'problematic narratives' and build healthier identities."
      how_it_works: "We externalize the problem ('Anger' vs. 'Angry child'). We explore family's story and how the problem became dominant. We identify 'unique outcomes' when family managed to resist the problem. We re-write family narrative toward a stronger, healthier one."
      best_for:
        - "Families 'negatively labeled' ('problem family')"
        - "Children with negative identities ('bad child')"
        - "Family traumas and painful stories"
        - "Families wanting to change their narrative"
      duration: "12-20 sessions"

# FAQ Mini
faq_mini_title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Family Therapy"
faq_mini_subtitle: "Everything you need to know"

faq_items:
    - question: "Do ALL family members have to be present?"
      answer: "Ideally yes, but not always necessary. Usually we work with members living together (parents + children). Very young children (under 5) can miss some sessions. Sometimes we start without a reluctant member and try to attract them later. Important: both parents should be present if possible."

    - question: "What if a child refuses to come?"
      answer: "It's normal for adolescents to be reluctant. Explain that therapy isn't about finding who's to blame, but about improving the family for EVERYONE. If refusal persists, we start without them and see how it evolves. Sometimes they come after seeing positive changes. In extreme cases, we can do individual sessions with them in parallel."

    - question: "How long does family therapy take?"
      answer: "Depends on complexity. For moderate problems (communication, conflicts), 12-20 sessions (3-5 months) are usually sufficient. For serious problems (traumas, complex blended families, abuse), it may take 6-12 months (20-30 sessions). We evaluate progress every 4-6 sessions."

    - question: "What if one parent sabotages therapy?"
      answer: "If a parent actively sabotages progress (doesn't respect agreements, undermines other parent), we'll need to discuss this behavior directly in session. Sometimes we discover 'sabotage' comes from fear or misunderstanding. If it persists, we may suggest couple therapy for parents before continuing family therapy."

    - question: "Can we do family therapy online?"
      answer: "**Yes!** Online family therapy (Zoom) can work well, especially with adolescents comfortable with technology. Important: entire family in same room (not each in different part of house). We need a large screen and stable connection. Some techniques (observing physical interactions) are more difficult online, but most methods work."

    - question: "What if problems come from ONE member (e.g. problem child)?"
      answer: "In a family, the 'problem child' is often the symptom of larger systemic problems. Their behavior may be a reaction to parental conflicts, unclear boundaries, or family stress. In family therapy, we don't 'fix' the child - we transform the whole system so they no longer need to be 'the problem'. And yes, you'll see dramatic changes when the system changes."

    - question: "Is it confidential? What if children say things about parents?"
      answer: "Confidentiality in family therapy is complex. General rule: what's discussed in family stays in family (we don't share with outsiders). Between members, we encourage honesty, but in a safe and constructive way. If a child reveals abuse or danger, we have legal obligation to intervene. Otherwise, we work for emotional safety for all."

## Why Choose Family Therapy With Me?

### Extensive Experience in Family Systems
15+ years working with families in all configurations: nuclear families, blended families, multigenerational families, families with rebellious adolescents, families with traumas. I've seen and helped hundreds of families heal.

### Authentic Systemic Approach
I don't look for individual blame. I understand that problems are in relationships and patterns, not in individuals. I work with the whole system for deep and lasting change.

### Scientifically Validated Methods
I only use methods with solid evidence:
- **Structural Therapy**: 70%+ improvement in children's behaviors
- **Strategic Therapy**: 65-70% improvement in behavioral problems
- **Bowen Multigenerational Therapy**: Effective for repetitive patterns

### Neutrality and Respect For All Members
I don't take any member's side. Every voice matters - parents, children, adolescents. I create a safe space where all can be heard without fear of judgment or punishment.

### Flexibility in Configuration
I understand not all members can or want to be present always. I work with flexible configurations, adapting therapy to your family's reality.
