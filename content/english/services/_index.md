## Why Choose My Services?

### Vast and Diverse Experience
With over 15 years of practice in psychological therapy, I've worked with hundreds of clients from all walks of life. From anxious students to couples on the brink of divorce, from rebellious teenagers to burnt-out managers - I've seen and resolved a wide range of human challenges.

### Proven Methods, Not Improvisation
All my services use scientifically validated methods with demonstrated success rates:
- **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)**: 70-80% improvement in anxiety and depression
- **EMDR**: Recommended by WHO for PTSD
- **Gottman Method**: 70%+ success rate for couples
- **Mindfulness**: 30-40% symptom reduction

### Integrative Personalized Approach
I don't limit myself to one method. I combine the best techniques from each approach to create a unique plan adapted to you. What works for one person may not work for another - that's why personalization is key.

### We Measure Progress, We Don't Guess
We use scientifically validated questionnaires (for anxiety, depression, relationship satisfaction) that you complete periodically. We compare scores to see objective progress. We don't work indefinitely without knowing if it's working.

### Maximum Flexibility
- **Office or online**: Both are equally effective (according to research)
- **Flexible schedule**: Sessions in the morning, afternoon, or evening
- **Emergencies**: Availability for crisis situations
- **Language**: Romanian or English

## General FAQ

### How much do the services cost?
Rates vary by type:
- **Individual therapy**: 250 RON/session (50 min)
- **Couples therapy**: 350 RON/session (75 min)
- **Family therapy**: 400 RON/session (90 min)
- **Organizational psychology**: Upon request (varies by project)

All services offer **package discounts** (10-15% reduction for 5-10 pre-paid sessions).

### How long does therapy last?
It depends on the complexity of the issue:
- **Mild-moderate issues**: 12-20 sessions (3-5 months)
- **Complex issues**: 6-12 months
- **Personal development/relationships**: May last 1-2 years

In the first session, we establish a realistic estimate based on your situation.

### Can I change the type of service?
Of course! Sometimes we start with individual therapy and realize the problems are in the relationship - then I recommend couples therapy. Or vice versa. We're flexible and adapt to your real needs.

### Is it confidential?
**Absolutely.** Confidentiality is sacred in psychotherapy. Everything we discuss remains between us, according to:
- The code of ethics for psychologists in Romania
- GDPR (European Data Protection Regulation)

The only legal exceptions (extremely rare): imminent risk of suicide/homicide or child abuse.

### How do I start?
Simple:
1. **Book a free consultation** (30 min) - we discuss your situation and identify the right service
2. **If you decide to continue**, we schedule the first full session
3. **We begin work** - we establish goals, plan, and session frequency

No obligations, no pressure. Just an honest conversation about how I can help you.
