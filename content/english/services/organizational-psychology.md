# FAQ Mini
faq_mini_title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Organizational Psychology"
faq_mini_subtitle: "Everything you need to know"

faq_items:
    - question: "How much does a complete organizational consulting program cost?"
      answer: "Depends on company size and problem complexity. For a small company (10-30 employees), a 6-month program (diagnosis + interventions + measurement) costs approximately 15,000-25,000 RON. For large companies (100+ employees), complex projects can reach 50,000-150,000 RON. ROI is typically 3-5x in the first year (through reduced turnover and increased productivity)."

    - question: "How long until we see results?"
      answer: "Quick wins appear in 1-3 months: improved communication, reduced immediate tensions, positive employee feedback. Measurable results (reduced turnover, increased productivity, cultural change) appear in 6-12 months. Deep cultural changes require 12-24 months. We measure progress at 3, 6, 12 months."

    - question: "Is it confidential? What information do you share with management?"
      answer: "**Strict confidentiality for individual data.** Psychological assessments, individual coaching, questionnaire responses are STRICTLY confidential. Management receives only aggregated data (e.g., '35% employees have high burnout') without individual identification. Exception: if someone reports harassment/discrimination or suicide risk, we must intervene (with consent if possible)."

    - question: "Do you work only with large companies or also with startups/SMEs?"
      answer: "We work with companies of all sizes. For startups (5-20 employees), we offer scaled packages: psychological assessments for key positions, coaching for founders, compact training. For SMEs (20-100), mid-size programs. For corporations (100+), enterprise programs with dedicated teams. Rates adapt to company budget and needs."

    - question: "What's the difference between HR consulting and organizational psychology?"
      answer: "HR handles processes (recruitment, payroll, contracts, policies). Organizational psychology handles PEOPLE and dynamics (wellbeing, leadership, culture, conflicts, motivation, performance). For example, HR can identify high turnover (30%), but organizational psychologist diagnoses WHY (burnout, toxic leadership, dysfunctional culture) and intervenes to solve the cause. We work very well together with HR."

    - question: "Do you also offer support for crisis management (restructuring, layoffs)?"
      answer: "**Yes.** Restructuring, collective layoffs, mergers are extremely stressful for employees and require psychological change management. We offer: empathetic communication to employees, change management workshops, coaching for managers who must communicate bad news, psychological support for laid-off employees (outplacement counseling), support programs for remaining employees ('survivor guilt')."

    - question: "How do you measure ROI of your programs?"
      answer: "We measure both 'soft metrics' (satisfaction, engagement, burnout - through questionnaires) and 'hard metrics' (turnover, absences, productivity, revenue per employee). Example: If turnover drops from 30% to 20% after program, and average cost of replacing employee is 30,000 RON, for company with 100 employees, savings are 10 × 30,000 = 300,000 RON/year. Program investment: 50,000 RON. ROI = 6x in first year."
