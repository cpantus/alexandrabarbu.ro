# FAQ Mini Section
faq_mini:
  title: "Frequently Asked **Questions** about Tests"
  faqs:
    - question: "Are these tests an official diagnosis?"
      answer: |
        No, these tests are educational self-assessment tools. They do not replace a complete clinical evaluation
        performed by a mental health professional. Results may indicate the need for consultation, but do not
        represent a diagnosis.
    - question: "How accurate are these tests?"
      answer: |
        All tests offered are scientifically validated and used in clinical practice. However, results depend
        on the honesty of your answers and the context in which you complete them. For an accurate evaluation,
        I recommend consulting with a specialist.
    - question: "What do I do if results indicate a high level of anxiety or depression?"
      answer: |
        If results indicate a moderate or high level of anxiety, depression or other psychological discomfort,
        I encourage you to schedule a consultation. Early intervention can prevent worsening of symptoms and
        significantly improve quality of life.
    - question: "How is my data protected?"
      answer: |
        All tests are completed locally in your browser. We do not store your answers or results.
        Data remains confidential and is not transmitted to any server. We strictly respect your confidentiality.
    - question: "How often should I complete these tests?"
      answer: |
        It depends on context. For monitoring progress in therapy, I recommend monthly completion or every
        2-3 months. For initial self-assessment, one completion is sufficient to identify areas where you need support.
