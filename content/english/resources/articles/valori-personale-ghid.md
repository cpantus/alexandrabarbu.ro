Many people live with the vague feeling that "something is missing," even when everything appears to be going well on the surface. Often, this sensation indicates a disconnection from personal values — the principles that truly define who we are and what matters to us. Identifying and living according to your values is not an abstract philosophical exercise but a practical process that can fundamentally transform the satisfaction and meaning in your life.

{{< highlight-box title="Key Takeaway" >}}
Values are not goals you reach and then check off. They are directions — like cardinal points on a compass. You never "arrive" at north, but you can always choose to move in its direction. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) places values at the center of a rich and meaningful life.

## What Are Personal Values

### Values versus goals

A common confusion is between values and goals. Goals can be achieved and checked off — "I want to get promoted," "I want to lose 10 kg." Values are ongoing qualities of action — "I want to be a dedicated professional," "I want to take care of my health."

{{< key-fact icon="las la-compass" label="ACT Definition" >}}
In Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Hayes et al., 2006), values are defined as "freely chosen life directions that function as intrinsic motivators of behavior." Unlike goals, values cannot be "achieved" — they continuously guide our choices.

### Values versus "shoulds"

{{< callout type="warning" title="Beware the should trap" >}}
Not all values you claim are truly your own. Some may be:
- **Inherited values** — adopted from parents without critical evaluation
- **Social values** — adopted from cultural or group pressure
- **Compensatory values** — chosen as a reaction to painful experiences, not from authenticity

The key question: "If nobody knew and nobody judged, would I still choose this?"

## How to Identify Your Values

### Method 1: Life domains exercise

{{< exercise title="Exercise: Exploring Value Domains" >}}
Think about each life domain below and answer the question: "What kind of person do I want to be in this area?"

1. **Romantic relationships/intimacy** — What qualities do I want to bring to my relationship?
2. **Family** — What kind of parent/child/sibling do I want to be?
3. **Friendships/social life** — What kind of friend do I want to be?
4. **Career/work** — What matters to me beyond salary?
5. **Education/growth** — How do I want to grow?
6. **Recreation/fun** — What brings me authentic joy?
7. **Health/physical well-being** — How do I want to care for my body?
8. **Spirituality/meaning** — What connects me to something greater than myself?
9. **Community/contribution** — How do I want to leave my mark on the world?

Do not rush. Return to this exercise on different days — the answers will clarify over time.

### Method 2: Peak moments exercise

{{< exercise title="Exercise: Moments of Fulfillment" >}}
1. Recall 3-5 moments in your life when you felt most alive, most aligned, most "you"
2. For each moment, answer:
   - What was I doing?
   - Who was I with?
   - What personal quality was I expressing?
   - What value was being honored in that moment?
3. Observe the common themes — these point to your deep values

### Method 3: The funeral question

Although it may seem morbid, this classic ACT exercise (Wilson & Murrell, 2004) is remarkably effective.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Tip" >}}
Imagine attending your own memorial. What would you want to be said about you by:
- Your partner?
- Your children?
- Your best friend?
- A work colleague?

The words you would want spoken point to your deepest values.

## The Most Common Human Values

{{< key-fact icon="las la-list" label="Research" >}}
Cross-cultural studies by Schwartz (1992) identified 10 universal categories of human values: self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition, benevolence, and universalism. Each person ranks them differently.
{{< /key-fact >}}

Here are some frequently encountered examples of values:

- **Authenticity** — being honest with myself and others
- **Compassion** — being attentive to the suffering of others
- **Courage** — acting despite fear
- **Curiosity** — continuously learning and exploring
- **Responsibility** — owning the consequences of my choices
- **Connection** — building deep relationships
- **Creativity** — expressing and creating
- **Fairness** — treating everyone equitably

## How to Live According to Your Values

### Step 1: Identify the gap

{{< steps connected="true" >}}
{{< step >}}Choose 3-5 essential values from the explorations above{{< /step >}}
{{< step >}}For each value, rate on a scale of 1 to 10: "How much am I living according to this value right now?"{{< /step >}}
{{< step >}}Identify the value with the largest gap — this is your priority{{< /step >}}
{{< step >}}Set one small, concrete action you can take this week in the direction of that value{{< /step >}}
{{< /steps >}}

### Step 2: Committed actions

{{< callout type="tip" title="Practical tip" >}}
Values become real only through actions. Ask yourself each morning: "What can I do today, however small, that is aligned with my values?" Examples:
- Value of **connection**: call a friend you haven't spoken with
- Value of **health**: go for a 15-minute walk
- Value of **curiosity**: read an article on a new topic
- Value of **authenticity**: express an opinion you normally hold back
{{< /callout >}}

### Step 3: Navigate obstacles

Living according to your values is not obstacle-free. Research from ACT (Hayes et al., 2006) shows that the main barriers are:

- **Cognitive fusion** — "I'm not the kind of person who..."
- **Experiential avoidance** — avoiding the discomfort associated with change
- **Lack of clarity** — confusing values with goals or external expectations

## When to Seek Professional Help

{{< callout type="warning" title="Signs it's time to consult a specialist" >}}
- You feel a persistent disconnection from meaning and purpose
- Your values are in acute conflict (for example, career versus family) and you cannot find balance
- You recognize you are living according to someone else's values but don't know how to change
- You experience apathy, depression, or existential anxiety
- You have gone through a major transition (divorce, loss, career change) and need recalibration
{{< /callout >}}

An ACT therapist can guide you through a structured process of values clarification and building a life aligned with them.

## Conclusion

Personal values are not a philosophical luxury — they are the compass that gives direction and meaning to your life. Identifying them requires honesty, and living them requires courage. You will not always be perfectly aligned with your values, and that is normal. What matters is to notice when you have drifted and to choose, once again, the direction that matters to you.

It does not matter how far you have gone in the wrong direction. You can always choose to turn around. Your values are waiting right where you left them.
