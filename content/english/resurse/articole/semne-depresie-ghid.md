## Sadness vs. Depression: What's the Difference?

It is essential to understand that sadness is a normal and healthy emotion. We all go through difficult periods that cause sadness—job loss, the end of a relationship, the death of a loved one.

### Characteristics of normal sadness

- It is related to a specific event or situation
- It decreases in intensity over time
- It allows for moments of joy or relief
- It does not significantly affect daily functioning over the long term
- It responds to social support and pleasurable activities

### Characteristics of depression

- It can appear without a clear trigger
- It persists for weeks or months
- It colors your entire life experience
- It significantly affects functioning at work, home, and in relationships
- It does not improve through activities that used to bring pleasure
