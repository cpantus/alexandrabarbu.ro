    ## Why I Became a Psychotherapist

    I chose the path of psychotherapy not by chance, but from deep conviction. During my psychology studies, I witnessed extraordinary transformations in the lives of people who benefited from professional therapy. I saw how people overwhelmed by anxiety learned to live with peace, how couples in conflict rediscovered connection, how old traumas can be healed.

    These experiences marked me profundly. I understood that psychotherapy is not just a profession - it's a calling, a responsibility and a privilege.

    ## My Professional Journey

    After completing my studies in Clinical Psychology at the University of Bucharest, I first worked in hospitals and clinics, then opened my own private practice. Each person I worked with taught me something new about human nature, resilience and the power of healing.

    I continued to study constantly - certifications in CBT, EMDR, Mindfulness, Systemic Therapy. Not for diplomas, but to offer my clients the most effective tools available.

    ## What Guides Me Today

    Today, after over 15 years of practice and over 5000 hours of therapy provided, I am more convinced than ever that **every person has inner resources for healing**. My role is not to "fix" someone, but to create a safe space where those resources can be discovered and activated.

    I believe in the power of empathy, the importance of scientific evidence and the uniqueness of each healing journey.
