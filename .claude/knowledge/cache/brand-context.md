## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Voice Attributes

- Maintain credibility without being stiff
- Example: "Let's break down attribution modeling" vs "Attribution modeling deconstructed"

**Confident but Humble:**
- Assert expertise without arrogance
- Acknowledge limitations and challenges
- Share learnings from failures
- Example: "We've helped 500+ companies improve ROI" vs "We're the best marketing tool ever"

**Helpful but Not Pushy:**
- Lead with value and education
- Soft CTAs that feel natural
- Customer success over hard selling
- Example: "Here's a free template to get started" vs "Buy now or miss out!"

**Data-Driven but Human:**
- Support claims with data and research
- Balance numbers with stories
- Use relatable examples
- Example: "87% of users see ROI in 30 days. Like Sarah from Acme Corp..."
