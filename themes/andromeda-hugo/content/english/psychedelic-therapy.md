## Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy & Integration

We offer specialized psychedelic-assisted therapy and integration services, utilizing cutting-edge research in consciousness studies and therapeutic applications of psychedelics. Our approach combines traditional psychotherapy with carefully guided psychedelic experiences to facilitate profound healing and personal transformation. All treatments are conducted in compliance with legal frameworks and clinical best practices.

### Clinical Approach

Our team specializes in psychedelic integration therapy, preparation protocols, and harm reduction practices. We work within established therapeutic frameworks including MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression and anxiety, and integration counseling for spontaneous or recreational psychedelic experiences. Safety, set, setting, and therapeutic relationship are paramount in our approach.
