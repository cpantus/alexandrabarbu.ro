  description: "Answers to the most common questions about the therapeutic process, costs and scheduling."
  questions:
    - question: "What's the difference between psychotherapy, psychology and psychiatry?"
      answer: "**Psychotherapy** uses conversation and psychological techniques to treat emotional and behavioral problems. **Clinical psychology** includes assessments and diagnostics, plus psychotherapy. **Psychiatry** is a medical specialty that can prescribe medication. I am a psychotherapist and psychologist, I cannot prescribe medication, but can collaborate with psychiatrists if needed."
      icon: "question-circle"

    - question: "How long does therapy last?"
      answer: "It depends on your goals. Short-term therapy (12-20 sessions) is effective for specific problems (anxiety, phobia, mild depression). Complex issues (childhood trauma, personality disorders) require 6-24 months or more. In the first session we establish a realistic estimate together."
      icon: "clock"

    - question: "How much do services cost?"
      answer: "**Individual therapy:** 250 RON/session (50 min). **Couples/family therapy:** 350 RON/session (75 min). **Organizational psychology:** Customized quote. I offer discounted packages: 5 sessions = -10%, 10 sessions = -15%."
      icon: "credit-card"

    - question: "Can I do therapy online?"
      answer: "Yes! Online therapy (via Zoom/Google Meet) is as effective as face-to-face, according to studies. It's ideal if you live in another city, have a busy schedule or prefer the comfort of home. Requires only stable internet connection and a private space."
      icon: "video"

    - question: "How do I know what type of therapy I need?"
      answer: "You don't have to know! In the first assessment session we'll discuss your situation and I'll recommend the most suitable approach. If you're not sure, select \"Not sure - would like a consultation\" in the form."
      icon: "compass"

    - question: "Can I change the type of therapy along the way?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Therapy is flexible. If you start with individual therapy and realize you need couples therapy, we can make the transition. Or if the initial method doesn't work, we adapt the approach."
