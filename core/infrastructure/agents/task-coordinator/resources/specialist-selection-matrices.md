## Common Mistakes

**Wrong:** marketing-director for "create 3 social posts"
**Right:** copywriter-haiku for quick social content

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using Single Agent for Complex Multi-Skill Tasks

**Right:** analyst → marketing-director → copywriter

### ❌ Mistake 3: Overloading Specialists
**Wrong:** Delegating 10 different deliverables to one agent
**Right:** Break into 3-4 focused agents, each with clear scope

### ❌ Mistake 4: Wrong Model Selection
