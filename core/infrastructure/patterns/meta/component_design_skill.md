# Pattern: Component - Design Skill

**Category**: meta
**Complexity**: simple
**Thinking**: N/A (specification pattern)
**Knowledge Required**: Design excellence principles from cc-visuals.md

---

## PURPOSE

Define structure, validation rules, and quality standards for **design-related skills** (frontend, UX, visual design, diagrams, typography, etc.) to prevent "AI slop" aesthetics.

**Specific to:** Skills that provide guidance on visual design, typography, color, motion, layouts, or any user-facing aesthetic decisions.

---

## INPUT

**Required:**
1. **Skill name**: kebab-case identifier (e.g., "frontend-best-practices", "ux-guidelines")
2. **Skill type**: Universal, Conditional, or On-Demand
3. **Design domain**: Frontend, UX, Data Viz, Typography, Color Theory, etc.
4. **Auto-activation triggers**: Design-related keywords

**Optional:**
5. **Resources**: Detailed design resources in resources/ subdirectory
6. **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

---

## RULES

### Design Excellence Requirements

**All design skills MUST include:**

1. **Typography Guidance**
   - ❌ Anti-patterns: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica (signal "AI slop")
   - ✅ Distinctive alternatives: IBM Plex Sans, Space Grotesk, Fira Code, Crimson Pro, etc.
   - Rationale: Why these fonts signal quality and professionalism
   - Pairing principles: High contrast, weight extremes, size jumps

2. **Color & Theme Direction**
   - Avoid clichés: Purple gradients on white = "AI slop"
   - Reference cohesive themes: Cyberpunk, brutalist, retro, corporate, RPG, etc.
   - CSS variable patterns for consistency
   - Dominant color + accent principle (not evenly-distributed palettes)

3. **Motion & Animation Principles**
   - Focus: One high-impact moment > scattered micro-interactions
   - Include `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility
   - Timing guidance: 200-600ms for UI transitions
   - GPU-accelerated properties only (`transform`, `opacity`)

4. **Background Design Techniques**
   - Teach layered gradients, not flat colors
   - Subtle texture/noise techniques
   - Never recommend: Pure white (#fff), pure black (#000)
   - Atmospheric depth over solid colors

5. **Anti-Patterns Section (REQUIRED)**
```markdown
## Design Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Generic fonts**: Inter, Roboto, Arial (signal AI-generated content)
❌ **Clichéd color schemes**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds
❌ **Flat backgrounds**: Use atmospheric depth with layered gradients
❌ **No variation**: Repeatedly using same choices across projects
❌ **Scattered animations**: Focus on one orchestrated moment
```

## What This Skill Does

Provides comprehensive frontend development guidance covering:
- **Design Excellence**: Typography, color, motion, backgrounds (avoid "AI slop" aesthetics)
- **Technical Best Practices**: React, Vue, TypeScript, performance, accessibility

Uses progressive disclosure: Main skill (<500 lines) + detailed resources on-demand.

## Frontend Design Excellence

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the **"AI slop" aesthetic**. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

### Typography: Choose Distinctive Fonts

Typography instantly signals quality. **Avoid boring, generic fonts.**

**Never use:**
- ❌ Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Arial, default system fonts

**Consider distinctive choices:**
- **Code aesthetic**: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Space Grotesk
- **Editorial**: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro, Newsreader
- **Technical**: IBM Plex Sans, Source Sans 3

[... continues with complete design excellence guidance ...]

## React Best Practices

[... technical content ...]

## When to Load Resources

**Typography & Design:**
- Font pairing, weight extremes → `@frontend-best-practices/resources/typography-choices.md`
- Theme galleries → `@frontend-best-practices/resources/design-themes-gallery.md`

---

**Auto-activation triggers:** frontend, react, vue, design, typography, theme, etc.
```

---

## PROCESS

1. **Identify Design Domain** (frontend, UX, data viz, typography, etc.)
2. **Create Skill File** with design excellence section FIRST
3. **Add Technical Content** AFTER design principles
4. **Create Resources Directory** with 3-4 detailed files
5. **Register in skill-rules.json** with design triggers
6. **Validate** against checklist above
7. **Test Auto-Activation** with design-related prompts

---

## REFERENCE

**Core Principle (from cc-visuals.md):**
> "You tend to converge toward generic, 'on distribution' outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the 'AI slop' aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive designs that surprise and delight."

**Key Anti-Patterns:**
- Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Flat colors without depth
- Scattered micro-interactions
- Cookie-cutter layouts

**Design Excellence Dimensions:**
- Typography (distinctive, not generic)
- Color/Theme (cohesive, not clichéd)
- Motion (purposeful, not decorative)
- Backgrounds (atmospheric, not flat)
