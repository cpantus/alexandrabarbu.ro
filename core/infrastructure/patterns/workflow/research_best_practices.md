# Research Best Practices Pattern

**Category**: Workflow
**Complexity**: Simple (Suggested)
**Purpose**: Specialized pattern for discovering current best practices from authoritative sources

## When to Use

Use this pattern when researching:
- Current best practices for technologies or frameworks
- Recommended approaches for common tasks
- Community consensus on how to use tools
- Up-to-date guidance (2024-2025)

**Examples**:
- "React Hook best practices"
- "REST API design best practices"
- "TypeScript strict mode best practices"
- "Error handling best practices in Node.js"

## Pattern Overview

This specialized pattern:
1. Focuses on **current, authoritative** best practices
2. Prioritizes **2024-2025 content** for fast-moving tech
3. Seeks **community consensus** across multiple sources
4. Provides **actionable guidance** with clear rationale
5. Flags **anti-patterns** and what to avoid

## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Official Guidance (60-90 seconds)
```markdown
1. **Context7 query**: "[Technology] best practices use context7"
   - Gets official documentation recommendations
   - Latest framework/tool guidance
   - Authoritative starting point

2. **WebFetch official docs**:
   - Guides section
   - Best practices section
   - Style guides (if available)
```

**Example**:
```
Context7: "React best practices use context7"
WebFetch: https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react
WebFetch: https://react.dev/reference/rules
```

### Phase 2: Community Consensus (90-120 seconds)
```markdown
1. **WebSearch**: "[Topic] best practices 2025"
   - Prioritize recent content
   - Look for consensus patterns
   - Authoritative authors/blogs

2. **WebSearch**: "[Topic] recommended patterns"
   - Alternative phrasing finds different sources
   - More pattern-focused results

3. **WebSearch**: "[Topic] style guide" or "[Topic] conventions"
   - Coding standards
   - Team conventions
   - Industry standards
```

**Example**:
```
WebSearch "React Hook best practices 2025"
WebSearch "React Hook patterns and best practices"
WebSearch "React coding conventions"
```

### Phase 3: Expert Sources (60-90 seconds)
```markdown
1. **Identify top 3-5 results** from searches:
   - Official blogs (React, Next.js, etc.)
   - Framework authors
   - Established experts (Kent C. Dodds, Dan Abramov, etc.)
   - Major tech companies (Google, Meta, Vercel)

2. **WebFetch** these authoritative sources:
   - Extract specific recommendations
   - Note rationale for each practice
   - Capture code examples

3. **Cross-reference**:
   - What do multiple sources agree on?
   - Where do they disagree (and why)?
```

### Phase 4: Anti-Patterns (30-60 seconds)
```markdown
1. **WebSearch**: "[Topic] common mistakes"
2. **WebSearch**: "[Topic] anti-patterns"
3. **Extract** what NOT to do:
   - Outdated practices
   - Common beginner mistakes
   - Performance pitfalls
```

**Example**:
```
WebSearch "React Hook common mistakes"
WebSearch "React anti-patterns to avoid"
```

## Search Query Optimization

### Effective Queries
```bash
# Good: Specific, includes year for recency
"React Hook best practices 2025"
"TypeScript strict mode best practices"
"REST API design best practices 2024"

# Better: Multiple angles
"React Hook best practices 2025"
"React Hook patterns and conventions"
"React Hook common mistakes"

# Best: Official + community
"React Hook best practices use context7"  # Official
"React Hook best practices 2025"         # Community
"React Hook anti-patterns"               # What to avoid
```

### Query Variations
For comprehensive coverage, vary queries:
1. **Direct**: "[Topic] best practices"
2. **Patterns**: "[Topic] recommended patterns"
3. **Conventions**: "[Topic] coding conventions"
4. **Style**: "[Topic] style guide"
5. **Anti-patterns**: "[Topic] common mistakes"

## Source Prioritization

### Tier 1: Official (Highest Priority)
- Official framework documentation
- Framework author blogs
- Official guides and tutorials
- Example: React docs, Next.js docs, official guides

### Tier 2: Established Experts
- Well-known framework contributors
- Authors of popular libraries
- Conference speakers on the topic
- Example: Kent C. Dodds, Dan Abramov, Theo Browne

### Tier 3: Major Tech Companies
- Engineering blogs from major companies
- Open source guidelines from Google, Meta, etc.
- Example: Meta Engineering Blog, Google Style Guides

### Tier 4: Experienced Practitioners
- Technical blogs with demonstrated expertise
- Popular tutorial sites (when recent and well-sourced)
- Example: CSS-Tricks, Smashing Magazine

### Skip: Low Quality
- Content farms (BestOf lists with no depth)
- Outdated content (pre-2023 for fast-moving tech)
- AI-generated listicles
- Promotional content

## Common Pitfalls (Pattern Usage)

### DON'T:
- ❌ **Accept single-source practices** - Always cross-reference
- ❌ **Include outdated practices** - Flag anything pre-2023 for modern frameworks
- ❌ **Omit rationale** - Always explain WHY a practice is recommended
- ❌ **Forget anti-patterns** - What NOT to do is as important as what to do
- ❌ **Miss context** - Best practices vary by project size, team, use case
- ❌ **Skip official docs** - Always start with Context7/official sources

### DO:
- ✅ **Cross-reference** everything across multiple authoritative sources
- ✅ **Prioritize recency** for fast-moving technologies
- ✅ **Include rationale** for every recommendation
- ✅ **Document evolution** - how practices have changed
- ✅ **Provide context** - when to use (and not use) each practice
- ✅ **Include examples** - code snippets demonstrating practices

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Implementation Research
```bash
# Planning to use React Hooks extensively
/research "React Hook best practices"

# Review findings
cat research/react-hook-best-practices.md

# Implement with best practices in mind
/workflow scout-plan-build "refactor to Hooks"
```

### Example 2: Code Review Preparation
```bash
# Team adopting new technology
/research "TypeScript strict mode best practices"

# Use as code review checklist
# Reference: research/typescript-strict-mode-best-practices.md
# Check: Are we following the DO list? Avoiding the DON'T list?
```

### Example 3: Team Onboarding
```bash
# New team member learning technology
/research "Next.js App Router best practices"

# Share research report
# Highlights: Core practices, common mistakes, quick reference
# Benefit: Faster onboarding, consistent practices
```

## Success Criteria

A successful best practices research report:
1. **Consensus documented** - Multiple sources agree on core practices
2. **Rationale clear** - Every practice explains WHY (not just WHAT)
3. **Examples included** - Code snippets demonstrate practices
4. **Anti-patterns flagged** - Clear guidance on what to avoid
5. **Context provided** - Practices adjusted for different scenarios
6. **Actionable** - Developer knows exactly what to do
7. **Current** - Reflects 2024-2025 best practices (for relevant tech)
8. **Authoritative** - Based on official docs + established experts
