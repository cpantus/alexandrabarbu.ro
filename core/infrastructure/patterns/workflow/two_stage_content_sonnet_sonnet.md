# Pattern: two_stage_content_sonnet_sonnet

**Category**: workflow | **Complexity**: complex | **Thinking**: think-hard
**Knowledge Required**: brand-voice-guidelines (full), audience-research (full), campaign-strategy-frameworks
**Quality Mode**: Maximum strategic depth for critical work

---

## PURPOSE

Generate brand-defining content with maximum quality through deep strategic exploration and systematic review.

**Key innovation:** Sonnet generates with deep thinking ($0.08), Sonnet reviews with strategic analysis ($0.04) = $0.12 total = **Same cost as direct sonnet work, but structured quality process ensures best-of-best thinking**.

---

## INPUT

**Required:**
- TASK: High-stakes content generation (brand manifestos, positioning statements, major campaign headlines, strategic narratives)
- QUANTITY: Number of variants to generate (typically 5-10 for deep exploration)
- TARGET: Persona (Strategic Sarah / Technical Tom) or audience description
- STAKES: Description of why this is critical (budget, visibility, brand impact)

**Optional:**
- GOAL: Awareness / Engagement / Conversion
- PLATFORM: LinkedIn / Email / Blog / Landing Page / Campaign
- CONSTRAINTS: Length limits, keyword requirements, messaging guardrails
- BUDGET: Campaign budget or visibility estimate (helps calibrate quality bar)

---

## PROCESS

### Stage 1: Deep Strategic Generation (Sonnet with think-hard)

**Use copywriter subagent with extended thinking:**

```
"Use copywriter subagent to generate [QUANTITY] [content type] variants for [TASK].

This is CRITICAL WORK:
[Explain why: $X budget, brand-defining, executive visibility, etc.]

Target: [PERSONA]
Goal: [GOAL]
Platform: [PLATFORM]
Constraints: [specific requirements]

Instructions:
1. **THINK HARD** about strategic approach first:
   - What makes this moment unique for the brand?
   - What is the core insight or truth we're revealing?
   - How do we differentiate from category norms?
   - What emotional and rational appeals do we need?
   - What is the strategic narrative arc?

2. Generate [QUANTITY] variants, each exploring a distinct strategic angle:
   - Benefit-focused (solve pain point, show transformation)
   - Insight-driven (reveal non-obvious truth)
   - Aspiration-led (paint vision of future state)
   - Provocation (challenge status quo)
   - Story-based (narrative that resonates emotionally)
   - Data-anchored (lead with compelling proof)

3. For each variant, provide:
   - The variant itself
   - Strategic rationale (why this angle, what makes it powerful)
   - Expected emotional response from target persona
   - Brand positioning reinforcement (how it strengthens brand)

4. Load FULL brand voice guidelines (not compressed)
   - Review voice-guidelines.md, tone-by-format.md, vocabulary-guide.md
   - Check forbidden terms and compliance requirements
   - Verify messaging hierarchy alignment

5. Load FULL persona research
   - Deep pain points, aspirations, language patterns
   - Decision-making triggers and objection handlers
   - Content preferences and engagement patterns

6. Include your top 3 picks with detailed strategic reasoning

7. Format output with clear strategic thinking documented"
```

**Expected output from Sonnet (Generator):**
- 5-10 deeply considered variants
- Strategic rationale for each
- Emotional/positioning analysis
- Top 3 recommendations with reasoning
- Total cost: ~$0.08
- Time: 3-5 minutes

### Stage 2: Strategic Review & Selection (Sonnet with analytical thinking)

**Use copywriter subagent for systematic review:**

```
"Use copywriter subagent to systematically review the [QUANTITY] variants generated in Stage 1 and conduct a rigorous strategic analysis to select the top 3.

Context:
- Task: [original TASK]
- Stakes: [why this is critical]
- Target: [PERSONA]
- Goal: [GOAL]

Variants to review:
[paste Sonnet generator output]

Instructions:
1. **Strategic Framework Analysis**
   For each variant, evaluate:

   ✓ **Brand Voice Alignment** (30% weight)
   - Tone consistency (professional, strategic, data-driven)
   - Vocabulary adherence (industry language, power words, forbidden terms)
   - Messaging hierarchy (positioning, differentiation, proof)
   - Compliance (no unsubstantiated claims, proper disclaimers)

   ✓ **Persona Resonance** (30% weight)
   - Pain point addressing (specific, relevant, urgent)
   - Language mirroring (matches how persona talks/thinks)
   - Value proposition clarity (transformation promise)
   - Objection handling (addresses concerns preemptively)

   ✓ **Strategic Soundness** (25% weight)
   - Differentiation (stands out from competition)
   - Positioning reinforcement (strengthens brand position)
   - Message memorability (sticky, repeatable, shareable)
   - Scalability (can extend to campaign, other channels)

   ✓ **Performance Predictors** (15% weight)
   - Based on benchmarks from brand-voice-guidelines
   - Historical data on similar messaging
   - A/B test learnings (what has worked before)
   - Engagement drivers (curiosity, emotion, utility)

2. **Scoring Matrix**
   Create detailed scorecard:
   - Variant [#]: [Total score] / 100
     - Brand voice: [X/30]
     - Persona resonance: [X/30]
     - Strategic soundness: [X/25]
     - Performance prediction: [X/15]

3. **Select Top 3**
   Rank by total score, but consider:
   - Diversity of approaches (don't pick 3 similar variants)
   - Strategic optionality (give decision-maker real choices)
   - Risk vs safe (include both breakthrough and proven approaches)

4. **Deep Analysis for Each Top 3**
   For each selection provide:
   - **Why This Will Win:** Strategic argument for effectiveness
   - **Brand Impact:** How it strengthens positioning long-term
   - **Risk Assessment:** What could go wrong, mitigation strategies
   - **Optimization Notes:** Minor tweaks to maximize performance
   - **Expansion Potential:** How to extend to full campaign

5. **A/B Testing Strategy**
   - Hypothesis we're testing
   - Sample size requirements (statistical rigor)
   - Success metrics (primary, secondary, guardrail)
   - Decision framework (when to declare winner, when to iterate)

6. **Executive Recommendation**
   If you had to pick ONE variant for immediate use:
   - Which one and why
   - Confidence level (and what would increase it)
   - Contingency plan if it underperforms

7. Format output as strategic brief ready for stakeholder review"
```

**Expected output from Sonnet (Reviewer):**
- Detailed scoring matrix for all variants
- Top 3 selections with comprehensive analysis
- Risk assessment for each
- A/B testing strategy
- Executive recommendation
- Total cost: ~$0.04
- Time: 2-3 minutes

### A/B Testing Strategy

**Hypothesis:**
[What we're testing: e.g., "Aspiration-led messaging outperforms benefit-focused for Strategic Sarah in awareness stage"]

**Test Setup:**
- **Variant A:** #1 ([Strategic angle]) - 50% traffic
- **Variant B:** #2 ([Strategic angle]) - 50% traffic

**Why Test These Two:**
[Strategic reasoning: different approaches, complementary strengths, risk/reward balance]

**Success Metrics:**
- **Primary:** [Key metric with target: e.g., "CTR >4.5%"]
- **Secondary:** [Supporting metric: e.g., "Engagement rate >6%"]
- **Guardrail:** [Don't harm metric: e.g., "Brand sentiment remains positive"]

**Sample Size Requirements:**
- **Minimum:** [Statistical calculation: e.g., "2,000 impressions per variant"]
- **Confidence level:** 95% (industry standard)
- **Minimum detectable effect:** [e.g., "20% relative lift"]

**Timeline:**
- **Duration:** [e.g., "2 weeks or until statistical significance"]
- **Check-in points:** [e.g., "Day 3 (directional), Day 7 (interim), Day 14 (final)"]

**Decision Framework:**
- **Declare winner:** When one variant shows >20% lift with 95% confidence
- **Iterate:** If both underperform expectations (<80% of target)
- **Run longer:** If trending right direction but not yet significant

---

### Executive Recommendation

**If choosing ONE variant for immediate use:**

**Selected:** Variant [#] - [Name]

**Rationale:**
[Strategic argument for why this specific variant, considering risk tolerance, brand goals, market timing]

**Confidence Level:** [High/Medium/Requires Testing]

**Based on:**
- [Supporting evidence 1: benchmark data, historical performance]
- [Supporting evidence 2: persona research alignment]
- [Supporting evidence 3: competitive differentiation]

**Contingency Plan:**
If this variant underperforms expectations ([define threshold]):
1. [Immediate adjustment 1]
2. [Fall back to variant 2 or 3]
3. [Conduct deeper research into [specific aspect]]

---

### Cost Analysis

**Total Cost:** $0.12 (Stage 1: $0.08 + Stage 2: $0.04)
**Same as:** Direct Sonnet work
**Value Add:** Structured quality process, systematic review, risk assessment
**Quality Level:** Maximum (best-of-best thinking with rigorous selection)
**Time Investment:** 5-8 minutes (vs 3-4 minutes direct Sonnet)

**Justification for s2 mode:**
When stakes are high (critical campaigns, brand-defining messaging, $100K+ budgets), the additional structure and systematic review justify the time investment even at same cost.
```

---

## QUALITY CHECKS

Before delivering final output:

- [ ] All top 3 variants score 80+ / 100 (if not, regenerate)
- [ ] Brand voice compliance 100% (no forbidden terms, proper disclaimers)
- [ ] Legal/compliance review clear (no unsubstantiated claims)

- [ ] Risk assessment comprehensive (identified risks + mitigations)
- [ ] A/B testing plan statistically rigorous (proper sample size, confidence)
- [ ] Executive recommendation is actionable (clear decision framework)
- [ ] Expansion potential documented (campaign scalability)

---

## VARIATIONS

**QUANTITY_OVERRIDE:** Generate 5, 7, or 10 variants (default: 5-7 for deep quality)

**EXTENDED_THINKING:** Add "think very hard" or "ultrathink" for maximum strategic depth
Example: "This is a $500K campaign, think very hard about strategic positioning"

**STAKEHOLDER_PERSPECTIVES:** Include multi-perspective review
Example: "Review from CMO lens, CFO lens, and Creative Director lens"

**ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT:** Go back to generator with reviewer feedback
Example: "Top 2 scores were <85, regenerate with specific feedback"

---

## USE CASES

**Ideal for:**
- ✅ Brand manifestos and positioning statements (foundational messaging)
- ✅ Major campaign headlines ($100K+ budgets)
- ✅ Product launch messaging (high visibility, competitive)
- ✅ Executive communications (CEO blog posts, investor updates)
- ✅ Category-defining content (thought leadership, industry POV)
- ✅ Crisis communications (reputation-sensitive messaging)

**NOT ideal for:**
- ❌ High-volume content (daily social posts - use sonnet-haiku)
- ❌ Quick iterations (A/B testing variants - use sonnet-haiku)
- ❌ Simple tactical copy (email subject lines - use sonnet-haiku)
- ❌ Time-constrained work (need content in <5 minutes)

## EXAMPLE

**Input:**
```
TASK: Headline for GrowthEngine's $500K product launch campaign
QUANTITY: 7 variants
TARGET: Strategic Sarah (C-suite, growth-focused)
STAKES: Major product launch, 6 months development, competitive market entry
GOAL: Awareness + consideration (drive to product page)
PLATFORM: Multi-channel (landing page hero, ads, email, PR)
CONSTRAINTS: <80 characters, must mention "AI" or "automation", avoid "revolutionary" (overused)
```

**Stage 1 Output (Sonnet, think-hard):**
```
Strategic Context Analysis:
GrowthEngine entering mature marketing automation space. Differentiation required: not another "faster/cheaper" claim. Core insight: marketers drowning in tools, need intelligent orchestration not more point solutions. Strategic angle: position as "marketing copilot" (AI assistance frame, not replacement threat).

Variant 1: Aspiration-Led
"Your marketing team, amplified: AI that thinks like your best strategist"

Strategic Rationale: Frames AI as amplification not replacement. "Best strategist" appeals to Sarah's desire for strategic excellence. "Amplified" suggests multiplication of existing capability.

Expected Emotional Response: Relief (help is here) + Aspiration (want to be best)

Brand Positioning: Positions GrowthEngine as partner for strategic marketers, not commodity tool

[6 more variants with full analysis...]

Generator's Top 3:
1. Variant 1 - Appeals to strategic identity, differentiates via "amplification" frame
2. Variant 5 - Data-driven angle, specific ROI claim with AI credibility
3. Variant 3 - Provocation, challenges status quo, memorable
```

**Stage 2 Output (Sonnet, analytical):**
```
Scoring Matrix:
Variant 1: 87/100 (Brand:28, Persona:27, Strategic:24, Performance:8)
Variant 5: 83/100 (Brand:26, Persona:26, Strategic:22, Performance:9)
[...]

🥇 #1: "Your marketing team, amplified: AI that thinks like your best strategist"

Why This Will Win:
- "Amplified" frame reduces AI replacement anxiety (critical for exec buy-in)
- "Best strategist" flatters while setting quality bar Sarah expects
- "Your team" emphasizes augmentation of existing capability (budget-friendly framing)

Brand Impact: Positions GrowthEngine as strategic partner, not vendor. "Copilot" positioning enables premium pricing, attracts sophisticated buyers, differentiates from "automation" commodity.

Risk Assessment:
Potential risk: "Thinks like" could raise skepticism (can AI really strategize?)
Mitigation: Product demo must prove strategic capability immediately
Confidence: High (aligns with persona research + "copilot" is trending in AI category)

[Full analysis continues...]

A/B Test Strategy:
Hypothesis: Aspiration-led ("amplified") outperforms benefit-led ("ROI") for Strategic Sarah
Sample: 5,000 landing page visitors per variant
Timeline: 4 weeks (long consideration cycle for enterprise)
Primary metric: Demo request rate >8% (vs 5% baseline)
```
